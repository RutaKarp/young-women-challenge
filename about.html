			<div class='title'>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</div>
			<h2> By Ruta, Oleksandra and Alyssa</h2>

			<div class='text'>
			<p> Looking back, we have all encountered discouragement from pursuing a professional career in business-related sectors in our respective countries - Lithuania, Ukraine, and the Philippines. Today, we are students of New York University’s Global Program which includes people from over 110 different countries and yet despite such multiculturalism, we notice a similar pattern. As illustrated in our interviews, we witness a lack of enthusiasm for jobs in fields like tax, audit, and consulting among our fellow female students. Yet why must that be the case? </p>

			<p> Our backgrounds and experiences have developed a strong sense of need to make female representation more equitable in the areas of audit, tax and consulting. Moreover, since we ourselves are determined to pursue these careers, we strive to make these professional paths more appealing to young female students and empower them to choose to work in audit, tax, and consulting. </p>

			<p> For the format of our presentation, we decided to create an interactive online game in light of today’s incredibly digitalized world as well as in line with our proposed solutions which include digital aspects. In the game, we have built out a pathway through which the female character explores the Young Women Challenge, including the context, problem, and solutions represented by carefully-chosen objects. Along the way, she can collect Deloitte icons that symbolize the necessary skills and experiences for her to succeed at the company; the collection of all icons reveals an encouraging message. </p>

			<p> As part of our research, we have identified three key obstacles which result in a lack of female applicants to companies like Deloitte: 1. Awareness, 2. Misperception of qualification requirements, and 3. Misperception of opportunities. In response to these challenges, we have come up with two key multidimensional solutions. Firstly, we advise Deloitte LU to create a mobile application which will help address the lack of awareness about various opportunities as well as serve as an effective platform for conveying critical information about the company. More specifically, the mobile application will feature information about Deloitte LU, existing job openings, the application process, information on upcoming events and workshops, as well as a resource for potential applicants to advance their skills. Additionally, the app will act as a platform for two new programs which we advise for Deloitte LU to launch, the first one being a Women’s Mentorship Program. This program will serve to encourage potential applicants to apply, but also promote Deloitte LU’s dedication to female empowerment, which leads to our second proposed solution - a reformed marketing approach. </p>

			<p> A reformed marketing approach will enable Deloitte LU to address all three of the obstacles as mentioned above and outlined in our deliverable. One key aspect of this rebranding is a Campus Ambassador Program, which will further Deloitte’s engagement with students, raise awareness about the company, as well as support potential applicants in their application process by providing them with a trusted community member whom they could approach. Finally, Deloitte LU should advance its leverage of social media platforms, namely Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and their microtargeting capabilities in order to reach a more diverse applicant pool and especially females. Furthermore, Deloitte LU should feature current female employees as well as campus ambassadors on their social media accounts in order to establish its image as a female-friendly company. </p>

			<p> All in all, we advise Deloitte LU to tackle the issues of awareness, qualification requirements misperception, and misperception of opportunities by creating a comprehensive mobile application, adjusting their social media marketing, and launching women’s mentorship and campus ambassador programs. By undertaking these initiatives, we believe that a firm as Deloitte will succeed in making audit, tax and consulting careers more appealing to young female students. </p>
